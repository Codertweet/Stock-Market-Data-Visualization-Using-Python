📝 Project Description
----------------------
Stock market data is inherently volatile and affected by multiple factors. This project focuses on visualizing and analyzing past stock data to identify patterns and trends that could potentially inform future decisions.

The dataset consists of daily stock information for companies in the NIFTY-50 index from 2008 to 2021, publicly available on Kaggle. Although the dataset includes around 50 companies, this project analyzes data from one selected stock for simplicity.
